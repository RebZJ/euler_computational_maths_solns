#Some of my Project Euler solns

Some solutions to project euler problems involving number theory, computational mathemateics, aglos and data structures. These were mostly done in python, I have done a few by hand in the past and have done others in other programming languages. I'll probably add more if I can find my solutions in C++ from years ago. 

Hope this might be useful to someone, they should all run under a min (mostly under 5-10 secs) on a mid-grade CPU.
